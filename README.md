## 💡 Idea 
While re-building my CV for the n-th time, I had an idea of creating an app that served the purpose of both showcasing my engineering skills, and proving a complimentary, mobile-friendly version of my paper CV.

The idea is to build this app "the right way", from creating the actual wireframe designs to building it with the latest technologies and uploading it to the store.
