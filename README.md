## 💡 Idea 
While re-building my CV for the n-th time, I had an idea of creating an app that served the purpose of both showcasing my engineering skills, and proving a complimentary, mobile-friendly version of my paper CV.

The idea is to build this app "the right way", from creating the actual wireframe designs to building it with the latest technologies and uploading it to the play store.

I've challenge myself at adapting the usual information that you find in a CV to a mobile environment, making sure UX and UI matched the user expectations, and can be intuitive enough.

## 👨🏼‍🎨 Concept and design
The concepts and mockups have been prepared using Figam, and the overall design system is based on <a href="https://material.io/design">Material Design</a>.

The main navigation component is an implementation of the <a href="https://material.io/components/backdrop">Backdrop component</a>, the idea was to somehow provide a way to filter the main content of the page using the backdrop, by selecting which part of the Resume the user wants to see.

Obviously there's also a Dark Mode version of the designs 🖤
